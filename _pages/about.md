Hello! Greetings from my personal website.

Iâ€™m Anuja, Anuja Raorane. I am a PhD student in the Solar System Evolution group at the Institute of Astrophysics, University of Vienna. I am part of the ERC Consolidator grant EASE (Early Earth, Venus, and Mars as Exoplanets) project, lead by Dr. Kristina Kislyakova. Currently, I am focussing on solar wind interaction with planets's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere and modelling the consequent non-thermal escape of atmospheric particles.

This website shares my publications, CV, talks, and some personal art and blog posts.

Story time!

My interest in research has been there from a very young age. I come from India and the government there started the Kishore Vaigyanik Protsahan Yojana (KVPY) scholarship to encourgae young minds like me to pursue science. As a proud recipient of the KVPY scholarship, I pursued a Bachelor of Science - Master of Science (BS-MS) degree at the Indian Institute of Science, Education and Research (IISER), Pune. My first exposure to astrophysics, happened through Astrobiology where I was fascinated by the interdiscplinary approach of finding the Origins of Life. For the pre-biotic chemistry to take place to form the precurors of life, the planet needs to fulfill some pre-requisite conditions. These conditions can come from the host star, where and how the planet formed, if it has an atmosphere and so forth. Subsequently, as an attempt to gleam on one of those questions, I did my master's thesis project on the topic "Formation of Saturn and distribution of its growth times", (not to brag) for which I recieved the Best Thesis Award in the Earth and Climate Science dept. at IISER Pune. I carried out this work at the Konkoly Observatory in Budapest and at IISERP. Even after the formation of planet in the right habitable zone, its potential depends on if it has an atmosphere (and hence atmospheric pressure) that can sustain liquid water on the planet, among other things Now, as part of my PhD, I am trying to understand the role of solar wind interaction and planet's magnetosphere on atmosphere retention.
