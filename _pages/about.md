Welcome to my personal website.

I’m Anuja, a PhD candidate in the Solar System Evolution group at the Institute of Astrophysics, University of Vienna. I am part of the ERC Consolidator grant EASE (Early Earth, Venus, and Mars as Exoplanets) project, lead by Dr. Kristina Kislyakova. Currently, I am focussing on solar wind interaction with planets's upper atmosphere and magnetosphere and modelling the consequent non-thermal escape of atmospheric particles.

Then, Here and Beyond
-----

I come from India and my interest in science took root early in life. After high school, I bagged the KVPY scholarship, awarded by the Government of India, which enabled me to pursue a a BS-MS dual degree from the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Pune. 

I first encountered astrophysics research through the lens of astrobiology, where  I was fascinated by the interdiscplinary approach of finding the Origins of Life. I found it captivating how so many factors — like the planet's host star, its formation history, and whether it possesses an atmosphere capable of supporting prebiotic chemistry. — all play a role in making the planet potentially habitable. In my master’s thesis, I explored one of these pieces of the puzzle through my project “Formation of Saturn and Distribution of Its Growth Times”. I conducted this research both at IISER Pune and the Konkoly Observatory in Budapest, and was awarded the Best Thesis in my department!

Now, for my PhD, I’m focusing on how interactions between solar wind, planetary magnetospheres, and atmospheres affect a planet’s ability to hold on to its atmosphere — a key part of understanding whether it could support life.
